At Elder Research, we listen to understand. In the world of brain science, mirror neurons burst onto the scene back in 1992. Like data science I mean machine learning I mean artificial intelligence, mirror neurons have gone through their own hype cycle, generating keen public interest then becoming less of a magical atomic explanation than first thought and then yet still continuing to be a rich field of study today. Though mirror neurons may not be foundational to human empathy as some once suspected, research still suggests they "contribute to low-level processing of observed actions." This computer-generated drawing based on the Elder Research corona logo consists of abstract neurons whose axons have moved toward each other in a mirrored iteration.

Describe your process - we are curious how you made this awesome design.

Short version: I used the computer to do it.

Longer version: I wrote an iterative algorithm involving trigonometry to get the axons on the drawing to grow toward one another. Once growth was working, I put in a bunch of graphics programming, measurements, and iteration. (Tools included the Clojure programming language, the Calva editor, the Clojure2D graphics library, ImageMagick, and xScope by The Iconfactory.)
